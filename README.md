# Table of content for UniversalViewer
An Omeka plugin to add a table of content (aka _index_) for items displayed with the [UniversalViewer](https://github.com/Daniel-KM/Omeka-plugin-UniversalViewer) plugin. The table of content is generated by the required plugin [PDF TOC](https://github.com/JBPressac/Plugin-PdfToc) from a PDF version of the item files. 

Installation
------------

- Install the [UniversalViewer](https://github.com/Daniel-KM/Omeka-plugin-UniversalViewer) and the [PDF TOC](https://github.com/JBPressac/Plugin-PdfToc) plugins. Please notice that this plugin will not work with the original version of [PDF TOC](https://github.com/symac/Plugin-PdfToc) by @symac.
- Download the plugin files or clone this repository.
- Rename the _Table of content for UniversalViewer_ plugin folder as "TocForUniversalViewer".
- Install it [like any other Omeka plugin](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Admin/Adding_and_Managing_Plugins/).

Use
---
To display an index in the Universal Viewer view of an Omeka item:
- Create a PDF version of the files of the item. 
- Create bookmarks in the PDF. 
- Upload the PDF to the item. [PDF TOC](https://github.com/JBPressac/Plugin-PdfToc) will extract the bookmarks from the PDF and store them in the text field of the _PDF Table of Contents_ element set of the PDF file (this set is created during the installation of PDF TOC).

The TOC should be displayed in the _index_ tab of the Universal Viewer. See an example on the [Bibliothèque numérique du CRBC](http://bibnumcrbc.huma-num.fr/document/24).

Note
----
This plugin uses the TOC generated by the _PDF Toc_ plugin because the items of our digital library [Bibliothèque numérique du CRBC](http://bibnumcrbc.huma-num.fr) were previously displayed with the BookReader plugin, which requires _PDF Toc_ to display tables of content.
